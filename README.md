# screen_shot_tool
a screen shot tool
i really love Snipaster, but I can't use it during my work. so here we are~

# v1.0.1
## 1. shortcut key: 
Ctrl + Alt + A
or
F1

## 2. Auto hide in the system tray.
   click right button will show 3 options:
   
     -- show tool's window
     -- hide tool's window
     -- quit 

## BUG
I have tried Pyinstaller and Nuitka many times, but I cannot package the 'res/icon' fold into the tools. I have no idea~

# v1.0.0
1. it shows a interface
2. take a screen shot
3. quit the tool
